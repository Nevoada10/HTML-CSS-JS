                HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web. 
                It provides the basic structure of web pages, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS.

                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML. 
                CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

                To start with HTML and CSS, you need a simple text editor and a web browser. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, 
                Sublime Text, Windsurf, or Atom. These editors provide helpful features like syntax highlighting and auto-completion.
            </p>
            <code>/* Link your CSS file in HTML */
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;
            </code>
            <p>
                Modern web browsers come with built-in developer tools that allow you to inspect and debug your HTML and CSS code. 
                These tools are essential for web development and can be accessed by right-clicking and selecting 'Inspect' or pressing F12.

                HTML elements are the building blocks of web pages. They are represented by tags, which label pieces of content such as 
                "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on. Most elements have an opening and closing tag.
            </p>
            <code>&lt;div class="container"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Main Title&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph with &lt;strong&gt;bold text&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
            </code>
            <p>
                CSS can be applied to HTML elements in three ways: inline (using the style attribute), internal (using the style tag in the HTML file), 
                or external (linking to a separate CSS file). External CSS is the most maintainable approach for larger projects.
            </p>

                Common HTML issues include incorrect tag nesting, missing closing tags, and improper use of attributes. Using a code validator 
                like the W3C Markup Validation Service can help identify and fix these problems.

            <code>/* Common CSS debugging technique */

            <p>
                Troubleshooting web development issues often requires a systematic approach. Browser developer tools are essential
                for inspecting elements, debugging styles, and identifying rendering problems.

            <p>
                One common question is about the difference between HTML5 semantic elements like header, nav, main, and article versus 
                using generic div elements. Semantic elements provide better structure and accessibility for your web pages.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another frequent question concerns CSS positioning and layout techniques. While traditional methods like float and position 
                were common, modern approaches like Flexbox and Grid provide more powerful and flexible ways to create responsive layouts.
